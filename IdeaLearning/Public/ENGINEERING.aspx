      <p>Engineering  is the application of scientific, economic, social, and practical knowledge in order to invent, design, build, maintain, and improve structures, machines, devices, systems, materials and processes .
   </p><p>   To ‘engineer’ literally means to “make things happen”. Engineering is about the design and production of useful products and services. Engineering know-how converts scientific knowledge into technology and then technology into successful innovation!. 
</p>
<h1>Why engineering???</h1>
     
<ul>
<li><a href="#" >Engineers have diverse careers</a></li>
<li><a href="#" >Engineers are in demand</a></li>
<li><a href="#" >Engineers get to do cool stuff</a></li>
<li><a href="#" >Engineers work everywhere</a></li>
<li><a href="#" >Engineers get to travel</a></li>
<li><a href="#" >Engineers work on interesting projects</a></li>
<li><a href="#" >Engineers have a good work/life balance</a></li>
<li><a href="#" >Engineers can earn good money</a></li>
<li><a href="#" >Engineers have a great lifestyle</a></li>

</ul>

<h1>Certainly there is life after Engineering: </h1>
<p>
Professional engineers with a university degree are working in many other situations outside engineering. An engineering degree is a good preparation for many different careers – especially ones that require financial analysis, quantitative or problem-solving skills.
Many young engineers are now doing double degrees, for example, in commerce, which enables them to work in industry sectors other than engineering.
Generally, engineering skills are transferable to many other jobs, for example, doctors, lawyers, or business managers.</p>

<h1>Basic skills for engineering:</h1>
<p>•	technical skills e.g. maths, science, computer skills
•	transferable skills e.g. communication skills, teamwork, technology, critical thinking – subjects that help give you these skills include English, History.
</p>

<h1> Why girls should opt engineering: ?</h1>

<p>Having more women working as engineers can bring different perspectives to the profession and enable project teams to generate more creative solutions that better address and meet society’s needs and the particular needs of women.
By attracting more female engineers, companies’ gain better understanding of their customers’ needs, improve product designs, and can compete more effectively in the marketplace.
</p>

<h1>Earnings of engineers:</h1>
<p>
The salaries in the engineering profession largely depend on the type of engineer and the level of training. A university qualification generally attracts more income than a TAFE qualification. Income is also dependent on the kind of company that a person works for. Variables include local government, consulting firms, multinational companies and research organizations.
</p>
<p>Another factor is the number of years working in engineering. Experienced engineers can earn over more per year depending on the discipline or industry sector .</p>

<h1> Engineering course duration: </h1>
<p>After your 10+2 To become a professional engineer you need to complete a four-year Bachelor’s degree.
Many students with a Bachelor’s degree go on to do a Master’s degree which can take another two to three years. Some students go on to complete a PhD (or Doctorate) which is another four to six years beyond the Master’s degree.
An engineering technologist usually has a four-year Bachelor’s degree in engineering. There are opportunities to do further study and progress to professional engineering status.
