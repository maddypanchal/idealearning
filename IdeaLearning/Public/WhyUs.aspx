                <p>
                    We focus on the concept building through clearing the fundamentals. To make it happen
                    in effective way we divide our whole strength in various groups called batches.
                    One batch contains students satisfying same grasping, working and reasoning standards.
                    Our teaching techniques and lecture content is also designed accordingly. Our batches
                    are re-shuffled time to time to maintain the craze and competitiveness among the
                    students. We conduct Mock Test and DPPs regularly for the article tought in classes.
                    The students who perform remarkably in our regular test are shifted to our topnotch
                    batch, called ‘Super 10’ we not only increase the level of complexity in practice
                    problem but also increase the no. of questions per unit time. In step-wise mentoring
                    we feel their emotions, their dreams, their vision, their frustration, their struggle
                    and their joys. We always stand behind to guide, to encourage, to motivate them
                    of every step.
