  <p> To become an architect one must earn a professional degree in architecture after completing one of the following programs offered at many colleges and universities:</p>
  <p>5-year Bachelor of Architecture program intended for students entering programs from high school or with no previous architectural training</p>
  <p>2-year Master of Architecture program for students with a pre-professional undergraduate degree in architecture or a related area</p>
  <p>3 or 4-year Master of Architecture program offered to students with degrees in other disciplines</p>
  <p>Generally, the professional degree in architecture must be from a school of architecture accredited by the National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB). A few states don't have this requirement.
   Architecture: </p> 
    <p>Architects design buildings and other structures. In addition to considering the way these buildings and structures look, they also make sure they are functional, safe, economical and suit the needs of the people who use them.
    </p>
<h1>Employment Facts:</h1>
<p>
There were approximately 113,700 architects employed in 2010, mostly in the architectural, engineering and related services industry. About a quarter were self employed. Most jobs were full-time positions, but if you're thinking 9 to 5, you're wrong. Many architects work over 50 hours a week and those hours include weekends and evenings. While they work in offices most of the time, they also have to visit construction sites to check up on the progress of the projects they have designed.
